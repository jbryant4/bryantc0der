							<p>Hi my name is Joseph Bryant but I go by Joe. I would consider myself a family man and a practical nerd. I have always had an interest in the tech world. Either playing video games, building custom computers, or just researching new programs, I find that there is so much to explore in this world. From a young age, I was always told that there is a time for work and a time to play. I am a firm believer that the quality of work put into a project will equal the quality of the projects output.</p>
							<p>Being the oldest of 8 kids in my family, I always knew that I wanted to have a big family. Nothing is more important to me than my familly, they are my pride and joy. My wife and I have been married for two and a half years. We have two adorable kids. An overly energetic boy named Samuel Joseph (SJ), who is almost 2 years old, and a 4 month old girl named Charlotte</p>
